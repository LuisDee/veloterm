Tasks 4 & 5: Write tests for window creation + Implement window creation with winit

Summary: Created src/window.rs with WindowConfig, DPI utilities, and App struct
implementing winit ApplicationHandler. 14 tests cover default config values,
WindowAttributes construction (inner_size, title, resizable), logical-to-physical
size conversion at various scale factors, and DPI-scaled font size calculation.

Files created/modified:
- src/window.rs (WindowConfig, App, DPI utilities, 14 tests)
- src/lib.rs (added window module)
- src/main.rs (updated to use veloterm::window::App)

Key decisions:
- winit 0.30.12 uses resumed() not can_create_surfaces()
- Window is a concrete struct, not Box<dyn Window>
- WindowConfig is separate testable struct from App
- DPI conversion uses simple multiplication (no rounding bias)
