Phase 5, Tasks 1-2: Render orchestration + window integration

Summary: Created Renderer struct in src/renderer/mod.rs as top-level
coordinator. Holds all GPU state, glyph atlas, grid, and render resources.
Integrated into winit event loop in src/window.rs with Arc<Window> for
wgpu Surface<'static> lifetime requirement.

Files modified:
- Cargo.toml (moved pollster from dev-dependencies to dependencies)
- src/renderer/mod.rs (Renderer struct, new/render_frame/resize, 5 tests)
- src/window.rs (App holds Arc<Window> + Option<Renderer>, event handling)

Key decisions:
- Arc<Window> required by wgpu Surface<'static> lifetime
- pollster::block_on() for async Renderer::new() in synchronous resumed()
- Surface errors handled: Lost/Outdated → resize, OutOfMemory → exit
- GPU resources (bind_group_layout, atlas_view, sampler) prefixed with _
  to suppress dead_code warning while keeping them alive
- Continuous redraw via window.request_redraw() in RedrawRequested handler

Quality gates: 124 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
