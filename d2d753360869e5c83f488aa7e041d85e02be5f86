Task: Write tests for terminal-to-renderer grid bridge + Implement grid bridge and color mapping
Phase: 3 - Grid Bridge — Terminal State to GPU Renderer

Summary:
Created grid_bridge.rs bridging alacritty_terminal cells to renderer GridCell data.
Red phase: 19 tests (17 failing, 2 passing for constants).
Green phase: Implemented 16 named ANSI colors, xterm-256 palette, RGB passthrough, grid extraction.

Files created/modified:
- src/terminal/grid_bridge.rs (NEW): Color mapping, grid extraction, 19 tests
- src/terminal/mod.rs: Added grid_bridge submodule, Terminal::inner() accessor

Key design decisions:
- 16 named ANSI colors use Claude Dark theme-appropriate warm tones
- xterm-256 uses standard 6x6x6 RGB cube (indices 16-231) + 24 grayscale (232-255)
- Named Foreground/Background variants map to theme defaults
- Grid extraction iterates row-major, producing GridCell with converted fg/bg colors
