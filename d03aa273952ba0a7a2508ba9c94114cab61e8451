Tasks 2 & 3: Write tests for theme color definitions + Implement theme color definitions

Summary: Implemented Color struct (RGBA f32) with from_hex() conversion and three
Claude theme constructors (Dark, Light, Warm) with exact hex codes from the UI guide.
39 unit tests cover all 11 color fields across all 3 themes plus hex conversion edge cases.

Also restructured project from binary-only to lib.rs + main.rs to enable cargo test --lib.

Files created/modified:
- src/config/theme.rs (Color struct, Theme struct, 3 constructors, 39 tests)
- src/lib.rs (new library root exporting config and renderer modules)
- src/main.rs (removed mod declarations, now uses lib.rs)

Why: Theme colors are the foundation for all rendering. Every GPU draw call
references these colors. Having them tested against the UI guide hex values
ensures visual fidelity across the Claude Dark, Light, and Warm themes.
