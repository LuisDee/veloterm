Phase 2, Tasks 3-4: Write tests for render pipeline + Implement pipeline and shaders

Summary: Created grid.wgsl WGSL shader and render pipeline infrastructure.
Shader handles vertex expansion (vertex_index to quad corners), NDC positioning,
atlas UV mapping, and fg/bg color blending via glyph alpha. CellInstance struct
(72 bytes, bytemuck Pod) matches shader input layout with 5 vertex attributes.
GridUniforms holds cell_size, grid_size, atlas_size. Bind group layout covers
uniforms, atlas texture, and sampler. 7 new tests validate struct sizes, vertex
buffer layout, shader compilation, and pipeline creation on real GPU hardware.

Files created/modified:
- shaders/grid.wgsl (vertex + fragment shader, uniforms, CellInstance)
- src/renderer/gpu.rs (CellInstance, GridUniforms, bind group layout, pipeline creation, 7 new tests)

Key decisions:
- Single draw call with instanced quads (6 vertices per cell, instance step mode)
- Glyph alpha sampled from R channel of atlas texture
- Fifo present mode with alpha blending enabled
- 72-byte CellInstance with 12-byte padding for alignment
