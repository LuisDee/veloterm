Phase 2 Checkpoint Verification — GPU Pipeline Setup

Quality Gates:
- cargo test --lib: 69 tests passed (0 failed)
- cargo clippy -- -D warnings: clean (no warnings)
- cargo fmt --check: clean (no diffs)

Manual Verification:
- cargo run: Window opens as decorated 1280x720 window with title "VeloTerm"
- Window displays dark background (#1A1816 Claude Dark theme)
- Window is closeable via title bar close button
- User confirmed: "Yes looks good now"

Bug Fixed During Verification:
- Window was opening fullscreen without decorations on second monitor (macOS multi-monitor)
- Fix: explicitly set with_decorations(true) and with_fullscreen(None) on WindowAttributes
- Committed as 73cae5a

Phase Summary:
- GpuContext: headless adapter/device creation for unit testing
- SurfaceConfig: testable surface configuration (Fifo present mode, Bgra8UnormSrgb)
- CellInstance: 72-byte Pod struct with 5 vertex attributes (instance step mode)
- GridUniforms: 32-byte uniform struct (cell_size, grid_size, atlas_size)
- grid.wgsl: vertex expansion, NDC positioning, atlas UV mapping, fg/bg blending
- Render pipeline: instanced quads, alpha blending, bind group layout (uniforms + atlas + sampler)
- 16 GPU-specific tests + 53 from Phase 1 = 69 total tests
