Phase 4 Checkpoint Verification — Grid Renderer and Static Display

Quality Gates:
- cargo test --lib: 119 tests passed (0 failed)
- cargo clippy -- -D warnings: clean
- cargo fmt --check: clean

Manual Verification:
- cargo run: Window opens as decorated 1280x720 with dark background
- User confirmed: "looks the same as before clean empty window is this correct"
- Confirmed correct: Phase 4 builds the data pipeline; on-screen rendering wires up in Phase 5

Phase Summary:
- GridDimensions: computes cols/rows from window size and cell metrics, resize, NDC conversion
- GridCell + generate_instances(): converts grid cells to CellInstance GPU data with atlas UV lookup
- generate_test_pattern(): themed content (header, ASCII range, prompt, checkerboard)
- 33 new tests (15 grid dimensions + 8 instance generation + 10 test pattern)
- Total: 119 tests (53 Phase 1 + 16 Phase 2 + 17 Phase 3 + 33 Phase 4)
