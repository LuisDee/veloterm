Phase 2, Tasks 1-2: Write tests for wgpu device/surface + Implement GPU context

Summary: Created GpuContext with headless adapter/device creation (no surface needed),
SurfaceConfig for testable surface configuration, and clear_color() for Claude Dark
background. 9 tests validate GPU creation on real hardware, adapter type, device limits,
surface config values, and theme color accuracy.

Files created/modified:
- src/renderer/gpu.rs (GpuContext, GpuError, SurfaceConfig, clear_color, 9 tests)
- Cargo.toml (added pollster dev-dependency for async test blocking)

Key decisions:
- Headless GPU creation (no surface) enables unit testing without a window
- PowerPreference::HighPerformance for adapter selection
- Fifo present mode (guaranteed available, v-synced)
- Downlevel limits for broader GPU compatibility
