Task: Write tests for PTY creation and shell spawning + Implement PTY management module
Phase: 1 - PTY Spawning and Raw I/O

Summary:
Created the PTY management module (src/pty/mod.rs) with TDD workflow.
Red phase: 7 tests written covering shell detection, PTY creation, read/write, and resize.
Green phase: Implemented PtySession with portable-pty and crossbeam-channel.

Files created/modified:
- src/pty/mod.rs (NEW): PtySession struct, default_shell(), PtyError enum, 7 tests
- src/lib.rs: Added `pub mod pty`
- Cargo.toml: Added portable-pty 0.9, crossbeam-channel 0.5

Key design decisions:
- Dedicated reader thread with 64KB buffer for PTY output
- Main thread writes directly to PTY (no writer thread for single-pane MVP)
- crossbeam-channel unbounded for PTY output delivery
- $SHELL with /bin/sh fallback for shell detection
