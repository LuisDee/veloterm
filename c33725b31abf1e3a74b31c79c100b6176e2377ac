Phase 3 Checkpoint Verification — Glyph Atlas

Quality Gates:
- cargo test --lib: 86 tests passed (0 failed)
- cargo clippy -- -D warnings: clean
- cargo fmt --check: clean

Manual Verification:
- cargo run: Window opens as decorated 1280x720 with dark background
- User confirmed: "looks good"

Phase Summary:
- GlyphAtlas: rasterizes 95 ASCII printable glyphs (0x20-0x7E) using cosmic-text
- Cell-sized slots in R8 texture atlas with power-of-two dimensions
- Buffer::draw() handles glyph positioning (baseline, bearings)
- Glyph mask coverage stored via color.r() (cosmic-text puts mask in R channel)
- GPU upload: R8Unorm texture, linear-filtering sampler, ClampToEdge addressing
- Bind group: uniforms (binding 0) + atlas texture (binding 1) + sampler (binding 2)
- 17 new tests (13 atlas rasterization + 4 GPU upload)
- Total: 86 tests (53 Phase 1 + 16 Phase 2 + 17 Phase 3)
