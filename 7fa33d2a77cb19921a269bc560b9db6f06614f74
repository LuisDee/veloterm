Phase 4, Tasks 1-2: Write tests for grid dimension calculation + Implement grid dimensions

Summary: Created GridDimensions struct that computes columns/rows from window
physical pixel size and cell pixel size (from glyph atlas). Handles resize by
recalculating columns/rows while preserving cell size. Provides NDC cell_size
and grid_size for shader uniforms. Minimum 1 column and 1 row enforced.

Files modified:
- src/renderer/grid_renderer.rs (GridDimensions struct, 15 tests)

Key decisions:
- Floor division for columns/rows (partial cells not rendered)
- Minimum 1x1 grid to avoid division by zero in NDC calculation
- cell_size_ndc = [2.0/cols, 2.0/rows] matches shader's NDC coordinate system
- All pixel dimensions are physical (already DPI-scaled by caller)
