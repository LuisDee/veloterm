Phase 4, Tasks 3-4: Write tests for cell instance buffer + Implement instance generation

Summary: Added GridCell struct and generate_instances() function that converts
a grid of cells into CellInstance data for the GPU vertex buffer. Each cell's
character is looked up in the glyph atlas to get UV coordinates, and the
has_glyph flag is set when a non-space character with a valid atlas entry exists.

Files modified:
- src/renderer/grid_renderer.rs (GridCell, generate_instances, 8 new tests)

Key decisions:
- Space characters and missing glyphs get zero UV rect and no has_glyph flag
- Out-of-bounds cells default to empty with black background
- Position is [col, row] matching the shader's grid coordinate system
- Colors passed through as [r, g, b, a] float arrays
