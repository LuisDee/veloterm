Phase 4, Tasks 5-6: Write tests for static test pattern + Implement test pattern display

Summary: Added generate_test_pattern() that fills a grid with themed visual
verification content. Row 0: "VeloTerm v0.1.0" in accent color. Row 1: empty.
Row 2: full ASCII printable range in text_primary. Row 3: "claude@anthropic ~ $"
in prompt color. Remaining rows: alternating '#' and '.' in text_muted.

Files modified:
- src/renderer/grid_renderer.rs (generate_test_pattern, 10 new tests)

Key decisions:
- Theme colors passed as reference for zero-copy color assignment
- Bounds-checked: content truncated to grid width, skipped if grid too short
- Alternating pattern uses (row + col) % 2 for consistent checkerboard
